FUNCTION
<<exit>>---end program execution

INDEX
	exit

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdlib.h>
	void exit(int <[code]>);

TRAD_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdlib.h>
	void exit(<[code]>)
	int <[code]>;

DESCRIPTION
Use <<exit>> to return control from a program to the host operating
environment.  Use the argument <[code]> to pass an exit status to the
operating environment: two particular values, <<EXIT_SUCCESS>> and
<<EXIT_FAILURE>>, are defined in `<<stdlib.h>>' to indicate success or
failure in a portable fashion.

<<exit>> does two kinds of cleanup before ending execution of your
program.  First, it calls all application-defined cleanup functions
you have enrolled with <<atexit>>.  Second, files and streams are
cleaned up: any pending output is delivered to the host system, each
open file or stream is closed, and files created by <<tmpfile>> are
deleted.

RETURNS
<<exit>> does not return to its caller.

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<exit>>, and specifies that <<EXIT_SUCCESS>> and
<<EXIT_FAILURE>> must be defined.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<_exit>>.
