newlib-nano-1.0
===============

 The newlib-nano is an open source C library (libc) targeting embedded microcontrollers (MCU).
Implementation focus is on code and data size reduction through optimization and removal of non-MCU features.

 It was originally developed for ARM Cortex-M based Scum as a part of the GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors
[see this link for more details](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+spec/newlib-nano).

newlib-nano is a derivative of the well known [newlib C library for embedded systems](http://sourceware.org/newlib/).

 This project goal is to enhance newlib-nano with additional features and extend support to additional MCU families.
